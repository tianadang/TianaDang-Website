        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-BusinessðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Tiana Dang. I am a 19 year old female born and raised in Hayward California. Born in the bay area has exposed me to a technological community, where I hope to be apart of and work with aspects of business there. I currently am a first year attending UC Riverside majoring in business. I am interested in art, anything musical related, and meeting new people. In the business field, I wish to concentrate in marketing and management. 
        <br><br>
        <br>         Previously, I have had experiences in customer service, volunteer work in Hospitals and Medical Centers, the Mike Bloomberg Campaign, and worked with Hayward Board Members to better school districts. I have had experiences in various fields and believe I have many skills and qualifications to make it into the marketing career. I have always had a passion to advertise and collaborate with people.I am continuing to grow my skills, which include: graphic design, experience with social media, organizing campaigns, and working well with others. I enjoy digging into customer problems and solving them with modern technology. It is prevalent to me that in today's society social media is crucial to meet others and thrive.  <br>
        <br>       In the future I wish to pursue a career in the social media or beauty industry, and hopefully create my own brand or company. One ideal goal is to create a boba shop. I have already experienced what it was like working at a boba shop, which helped heighten my goal. The idea of having my own sparked my desire to create my own brand.
        Another dream of mine is creating my own makeup brand, or working and collaborating creatively with a existing brand.
        I have always enjoyed anything art related. Whether it be drawing, sketching, painting, or even doodles, I have always leaned towards art creatively. To create a brand or your own company is very difficult and takes a lot of patience, determination, and effort. I believe I qualify with these skills and roles, and know that creating a business is a lot more harder than people think. 
        Another job profession I would love to have one day is something in the music industry. I have always loved singing and dancing and have been involved with dance and choir classes since middle school. I've been in four musicals in my highschool, and it really sparked a lot of joy in my life. I know being on broadway may be a reach to many, but that has always been a dream job of mine.
        The musical industry is bustling, and it takes a lot of dedication and talent. I would also be interested in writing musicals and plays and maybe even directing or choreographing for a musical. I was pondering on the thought of helping direct my high school's musical one day. I personally know an alumni from my school who directed as a side job, and it really interested me now. For my profession, I'm leaning towards creating a business, but I definitely want to pursue in singing, dancing, or creating art in my profession.
